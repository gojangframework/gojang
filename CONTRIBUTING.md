### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** with clear, concise commits
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Submit a pull request!**

#### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or docs/ with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have sign-off from maintainers

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific package
go test ./gojang/http/handlers
```

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting: `go fmt ./...`
- Run the linter: `go vet ./...`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

**Good:**
```go
// CreateProduct creates a new product with the given details
func (h *ProductHandler) CreateProduct(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Less Good:**
```go
func (h *ProductHandler) CP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // What's CP?
    // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** `lowercase_with_underscores.go` or `lowercasecamelcase.go`
- **Types:** `PascalCase` (exported) or `camelCase` (unexported)
- **Functions:** `PascalCase` (exported) or `camelCase` (unexported)
- **Variables:** `camelCase` or short names for short scopes (`i`, `err`)

## Performance Considerations

When contributing, keep performance in mind:

- ‚úÖ Use eager loading for relationships: `.WithAuthor()`
- ‚úÖ Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- ‚úÖ Paginate large result sets
- ‚úÖ Avoid N+1 queries
- ‚úÖ Cache static assets
- ‚ùå Don't load unbounded result sets
- ‚ùå Don't make unnecessary database calls in loops

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount. When contributing:

- ‚úÖ Validate all user input
- ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries (Ent handles this)
- ‚úÖ Sanitize HTML output (templates handle this)
- ‚úÖ Use CSRF protection (already implemented)
- ‚úÖ Hash passwords properly (use `security.HashPassword`)
- ‚ùå Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- ‚ùå Never trust user input
- ‚ùå Never build raw SQL queries

## Release Process

For maintainers:

1. Update CHANGELOG.md
2. Update version in relevant files
3. Create git tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
5. Create GitHub release with changelog
